## Python Dependencies

You do **not** need to install these manually. When you run the start command from the `README.md` (`uv run --python 3.12 ...`), `uv` will automatically download and install these in an isolated environment based on the `requirements.txt`:

- `flask==3.0.2` (Web server to serve the frontend and proxy requests)
- `requests==2.31.0` (For HTTP requests)
- `earthengine-api==0.1.391` (To fetch real-world terrain textures)
- `google-cloud-aiplatform==1.42.1` (Vertex AI SDK to perform image-to-image terraforming)
